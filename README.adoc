This is a minimal link:https://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis] application, intended as a starting point to learn what the framework is all about.

[TIP]
====
For real-world development, we recommend you instead start with the link:https://github.com/apache/isis-app-simpleapp[SimpleApp] starter app.

It provides more structure and includes examples of fixtures, unit tests, integration tests, and BDD (Cucumber) specs.

mv $REPO-$BRANCH $REPO
cd $REPO
----

* Build using Maven:

== Development

Apache Isis uses DataNucleus as its ORM, which requires that any entities are "enhanced", a post-compile process.

Normally this is done as part of a "mvn clean install", but the entities can also be enhanced explicity using:

[source,bash]
----
mvn datanucleus:enhance -o
----

This is useful to know if the application fails to bootstrap, complaining of "unenhanced entities".

TIP: You can also use `enhance-all.sh`
